# toymap: Toy technology mapper

Toymap maps logic networks onto LUTs or simple logic gates. The basic principle is cutting up an And-Invertor Graph representing the desired logic function into small subgraphs such that each subgraph can be implemented with (mapped onto) a LUT or a simple gate. Technology mapping like this is a step in the compilation of logic designs to be programmed onto an FPGA or manufactured as an IC.

Some features:

 * Employs the method of "priority cuts" to come up with candidate cuts of the graph (see the reference below)

 * Attempts to preserve wire names

 * Uses internal representation capable of expressing sequential circuits

     * This isn't useful yet since only acyclic graphs can be mapped and sequential elements are ignored in depth estimation. Import, export and emission of LUTs do handle sequential circuits correctly.

 * Integrates into [Yosys](https://github.com/yosysHQ/yosys)

## Build

    yosys-config --build toymap.so toymap.cc lutdepth.cc
